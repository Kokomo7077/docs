### SourceCred Overview
SourceCred (in the most basic sense) is an algorithm that determines how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall. Cred flows from the contribution to all the people and other contributions that supported it.[^1]

### Setting up a Template Instance
To set up a SourceCred instance, you would first need to fork the template repo from Github, then you can add in the supported plugins to pull in the contributions. (Currently supported plugins include Github, Discourse, and Discord). 
If you would like to try to set up an instance, please refer to the [Template Instance Repo](https://github.com/sourcecred/template-instance).
